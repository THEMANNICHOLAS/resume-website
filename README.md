# My Resume Website

Welcome to my resume website repository! This project is a personal portfolio site built with JavaScript, [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), and CSS, along with all the powerful tools and features that come with a Next.js project.

## Overview

This website is designed to showcase my professional background, projects, skills, and experience. Although the website is still under active development, I am sharing it on GitHub to document its progress and to keep a public record of improvements and new features as they are added.

## Current Status

- **Work in Progress:** The site is not yet complete, and many features are still being developed. Your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: The core programming language used to build the website.
- **Next.js**: A React framework that provides server-side rendering, static site generation, and many other optimizations out of the box.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout to create a visually appealing and responsive design.
- **Additional Tools**: All standard tools and best practices included in a Next.js project, such as ESLint for linting tailwindcss
